## Our history

We are a team of Blockchain veterans.
Since 2016, we have participated in the democratization of this technology. From crypto-currency mining to the creation of smart-contracts, we have spent the last 6 years exploring the potential and challenges of decentralized systems with industry leaders.

In 2021, our team of enthusiasts came together to create Cometh with the ambition to exploit the benefits of blockchain in a game.  Regardless of our experience, managing several thousand users on our web3 application has proven to be very complex. Testing out frameworks for our own use, for friend and partner projects, we developed an internal tool suite under the code name: *Alembic* ⚗️.

## The pragmatic web3 development platform

Whether you are taking your brand for a first step into web3, releasing a collection of NFT, building a video game, a marketplace, or even a decentralized finance project, your users will always expect a web2 experience.

Whatever the quality of the content and the perceived value of the blockchain, success will always come along with the simplest onboarding and the least transaction friction. 

The Alembic was iteratively crafted for us to onboard thousands of users unfamiliar with cryptocurrency or blockchain.  We had to withstand traction on an initially naive tech stack and we gradually optimized each component.  

The platform architecture has 4 main layers which can be used together or separately

>### Specialized APIs
>
>An application cannot efficiently fetch data from a blockchain node RPC endpoint.  The Alembic exposes robust yet flexible specialized APIs to launch Blockchain products. The complexity is abstracted for all monetization and front-end use cases (NFT Metadata, AMM, Marketplace, Rental system).

>### Smart-Contract suite
>
>The Alembic smart-contract suite is designed to manage NFT use cases in Web3 projects.  The entire codebase has been both audited and battle-tested by tens of thousands of unique users. Covered stories range from:
>
>- NFT distribution, with or without allow list, voucher control and gating,
>- NFT Rental, with or without collateral, reward distribution and sub-rental [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4vLq5_D-cQ),
>- NFT Crafting, with or without lootbox, token (ERC20 or NFT) sources and market price control [watch the video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jN-AewUgfI),
>- Advanced DeFi protocol integrations
>

>### Indexing Engine & Transaction Relaying
>
>An indexing and querying engine beats at the heart of the Alembic. Its powerful set of listeners retrieve and store blockchain events. The engine gives a cheap and efficient access to consistent on-chain data in motion, even in cases of reorgs or inconsistencies.
>
>The complexity of writing in the blockchain, wether it is for the application or its users, is taken care of by the Alembic transaction relay service. It offers a seamless experience that gets rid of the edge cases and gas management hiccups. [Read more](/usecases/discord)

>### App-chain: Rollup as a service
>
>The most blockchain heavy applications need their own execution layer.  The Alembic provides a Rollup infrastructure as a service that both preserves interoperability with Ethereum and maximises security. 
>
>The Alembic favours full compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine for total portability of existing smart contracts and wallets. Rollups based on Optimism are already live in production and support for Polygon zkEVM is planned.
>
>With the Alembic app-chains, applications are guaranteed for a future proof and long term support of the Ethereum roadmap.
